## Analysis & Recommendations for GP (Governance & Policy)

### Key Observations

1. **Consistent Structure**: Both SM and PC practices have identical structure across all 6 domains
   - Each domain has 3 maturity levels
   - Each level has 3 assessment questions
   - Total: 9 questions per practice per domain

2. **Total Question Count**: 108 questions (54 SM + 54 PC)

3. **Coverage**: Both practices span all 6 domains:
   - Software
   - Infrastructure
   - Endpoints
   - Data
   - Processes
   - Vendors

### Consolidation Strategy

When merging SM and PC into GP (Governance & Policy):

1. **Maintain Domain Coverage**: Ensure all 6 domains are represented
2. **Preserve Maturity Levels**: Keep the 3-level structure (1, 2, 3)
3. **Question Integration**: Consider whether to:
   - Combine related questions from SM and PC
   - Keep all 6 questions per level (3 from SM + 3 from PC)
   - Reduce to 3-4 most critical questions per level

4. **Naming Convention**: Update question IDs from `sm_*` and `pc_*` to `gp_*`

### Question ID Patterns

**Current Pattern:**
- SM: `sm_{domain}_l{level}_q{number}`
- PC: `pc_{domain}_l{level}_q{number}`

**Proposed GP Pattern:**
- GP: `gp_{domain}_l{level}_q{number}`
