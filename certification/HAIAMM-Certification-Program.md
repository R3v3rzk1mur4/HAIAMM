## 1. Program Overview

### Purpose

The HAIAMM Certification Program provides organizations with independent, third-party validation of their Human-Assisted Intelligence (HAI) security governance maturity. Certification demonstrates to regulators, customers, and stakeholders that an organization has implemented systematic controls for secure AI deployment.

### Value Proposition

|-------------|-------|
| **Regulators** | Documented evidence of AI governance for EU AI Act, HIPAA, SEC compliance |
| **Board/Executives** | Quantified risk posture and maturity progression |
| **Customers** | Assurance that AI systems are governed responsibly |
| **Insurers** | Evidence for cyber insurance underwriting |
| **Partners** | Third-party validation for vendor assessments |

### Regulatory Alignment

HAIAMM Certification provides compliance evidence for:

- **EU AI Act** (August 2026) - Risk management system requirements
- **HIPAA Security Rule** (May 2026) - AI in risk analysis requirements
- **SEC AI Examination Priorities** (2026) - Adequate policies and procedures
- **NIST AI RMF** - Governance and risk management alignment
- **ISO 42001** - AI management system requirements

## 4. Certification Criteria

### Maturity Level Requirements

| **HAIAMM Level 3 Certified** | ≥75% of L1-L2 AND ≥50% of L3 criteria met |

### Scoring Methodology

**Per Question:**
- Yes (fully implemented with evidence) = 2 points
- Partial (partially implemented or planned) = 1 point
- No (not implemented) = 0 points

**Practice Score Calculation:**
```
Practice Score = (Points Earned / Maximum Points) × 100%
```

**Maturity Level Determination:**
```
L1 Score ≥ 75%                    → Level 1 Certified
L1 Score ≥ 75% AND L2 Score ≥ 60% → Level 2 Certified
L1-L2 Scores met AND L3 ≥ 50%     → Level 3 Certified
```

### Critical Deficiency Rules

Certification may be withheld or conditional if:

1. **Critical AI Risks (EA, AGH, TM, RA):** Score below 50% on any critical risk category
2. **Core Practice Failure:** Score below 40% on Security Requirements (SR) or Monitoring & Logging (ML)
3. **Evidence Gap:** Unable to provide evidence for more than 20% of claimed implementations
