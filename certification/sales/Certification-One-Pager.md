# HAIAMM Certification
## Prove Your AI Security Governance Maturity

## The Challenge

**By August 2026, you need to prove AI governance to regulators.**

- **EU AI Act** enforcement begins - penalties up to €35M or 7% revenue
- **HIPAA Security Rule** updates require AI in risk analysis
- **SEC** examination priorities focus on AI policies and human oversight
- **Cyber insurers** increasingly require AI governance documentation

**Your board is asking: "How mature is our AI security governance?"**

Most organizations can't answer with evidence.
