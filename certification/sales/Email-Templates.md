## Sequence 1: Healthcare Payer CISO

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** [Company] AI governance before HIPAA May 2026?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

The HIPAA Security Rule updates taking effect May 2026 require AI tools to be included in your risk analysis for the first time.

With [Company]'s investment in [AI initiative - e.g., "clinical AI assistants" or "prior authorization automation"], you're likely thinking about how to document AI governance for auditors.

HAIAMM is the only maturity framework designed specifically for Human-AI collaboration security. We've helped healthcare organizations:

- Quantify AI governance maturity (not just policies, but evidence)
- Map controls to HIPAA, EU AI Act, and OWASP requirements
- Build audit-ready documentation before compliance deadlines

Would a 20-minute call to discuss your AI governance approach be valuable?

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: [Company] AI governance before HIPAA May 2026?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on AI governance - I know CISOs are buried right now.

One stat that might be relevant: 97% of organizations that experienced AI breaches lacked proper AI access controls (IBM 2025). The average AI-related breach cost $4.8M.

Given [Company]'s scale of AI deployment, I'd imagine demonstrating governance to the board and regulators is a priority.

Happy to share how other healthcare payers are approaching this. 20 minutes?

### Email 3: Value Add (Day 8)

**Subject:** HIPAA AI compliance checklist for [Company]

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I put together a quick checklist of the HIPAA Security Rule AI requirements taking effect May 2026:

✓ AI tools included in risk analysis
✓ AI access controls documented
✓ AI training data handling procedures
✓ ePHI in AI workflows protected
✓ BAAs in place for any AI vendors

If you'd like the full HIPAA AI Compliance Guide we created, happy to send it over.

Also still available to discuss how HAIAMM certification helps healthcare organizations document this for auditors.

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject:** Closing the loop on AI governance

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short - I've reached out a few times about AI governance ahead of the HIPAA updates.

If it's not a priority right now, totally understand. I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't follow up again.

If things change before May 2026, here's my calendar: [Link]

Wishing you and the [Company] security team well.

## Sequence 2: Financial Services CISO

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** SEC AI examination priorities + [Company]

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

The SEC's 2026 examination priorities explicitly call out AI oversight - specifically "adequate policies and procedures" and "human-in-the-loop oversight."

Given [Company]'s AI capabilities [reference specific - e.g., "in trading algorithms" or "fraud detection"], I imagine you're thinking about how to demonstrate governance during examinations.

HAIAMM is the only framework that assesses Human-AI collaboration security maturity. We help financial services firms:

- Quantify governance maturity with evidence (not just policies)
- Map controls to SEC, EU AI Act, and NIST AI RMF requirements
- Prepare examination-ready documentation

Worth a 20-minute conversation?

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: SEC AI examination priorities + [Company]

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up - SEC examiners are increasingly asking for AI governance evidence, and the EU AI Act enforcement begins August 2026.

One thing we're hearing from financial services CISOs: they have AI policies, but can't demonstrate maturity when asked. There's no measurement framework.

That's exactly what HAIAMM provides - a way to quantify and prove your AI governance posture.

Happy to share how firms like [peer company] are approaching this.

## Sequence 3: AI/ML Platform Leader

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Scaling AI governance at [Company]

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on [Company]'s AI platform expansion - I saw [reference news, product launch, or LinkedIn post].

As you scale AI agents in production, I'm curious: how are you measuring security governance maturity across the platform?

Most organizations have point controls (guardrails, access management) but struggle to assess overall governance posture. That's what HAIAMM addresses.

HAIAMM is a maturity model specifically for Human-AI collaboration security. It covers:

- 12 practices across governance, design, verification, and operations
- 4 critical AI risks (excessive agency, goal hijack, tool misuse, rogue agents)
- Regulatory mapping (EU AI Act, HIPAA, SEC)

Would love to discuss how this might complement your platform security approach.

## Sequence 4: Consulting Partner Outreach

### Email 1: Partnership Inquiry

**Subject:** AI security governance partnership opportunity

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because [Firm Name] has a strong reputation in security consulting, and I believe there's a partnership opportunity in AI governance.

HAI-Security developed HAIAMM - the only maturity framework for Human-AI collaboration security. With EU AI Act enforcement in August 2026, we're seeing significant demand for AI governance assessments.

We're building a Certified Assessment Partner program and looking for firms like [Firm Name] to deliver HAIAMM certifications.

**Partner benefits:**
- New revenue stream (assessments $35K-$150K)
- Differentiated AI security offering
- Lead referrals from HAI-Security
- Certified Assessor training for your consultants

Would you be open to a 30-minute call to explore partnership?

### Email 2: Follow-up with Value

**Subject:** Re: AI security governance partnership opportunity

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on the HAIAMM partnership opportunity.

I wanted to share some context on market demand:

- 85% of enterprises increasing AI security spend (2025)
- EU AI Act penalties up to €35M or 7% revenue
- 46% of security teams lack AI security expertise

This creates a significant advisory opportunity. [Firm Name]'s clients are likely asking about AI governance, and HAIAMM provides the methodology to deliver.

Our partner program includes:
- Certified Assessor training ($5K value, included)
- Co-marketing and lead sharing
- White-label delivery capability

Worth a conversation?

### "Not Right Now" Response

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Completely understand - timing is everything.

A few thoughts on when it might make sense to revisit:

- **3-4 months before compliance deadline** - Gives time for assessment + remediation
- **Before board/audit committee meeting** - Provides quantified AI governance posture
- **After AI security incident** - Framework for systematic improvement

I'll set a reminder to check back in [timeframe]. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if priorities shift.

Best,

### Competitor Comparison Request

**Subject:** Re: How does HAIAMM compare to [Competitor]?

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Great question. Here's how HAIAMM compares:

**vs. NIST AI RMF:**
NIST provides principles; HAIAMM provides measurable maturity levels. We map to NIST and add assessment methodology.

**vs. ISO 42001:**
ISO 42001 is a management system standard; HAIAMM is a maturity model. We help you measure progress toward ISO compliance.

**vs. Point Solutions (Lakera, Protect AI):**
Those are technical tools (guardrails, scanning). HAIAMM assesses organizational governance - including whether you're using those tools effectively.

**HAIAMM's unique value:**
- Only framework for Human-AI collaboration security
- Maturity model with quantified scoring
- Maps to multiple regulations (EU AI Act, HIPAA, SEC)
- Evidence-based assessment methodology

Happy to discuss in more detail.
