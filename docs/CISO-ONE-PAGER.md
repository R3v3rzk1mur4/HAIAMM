## The Critical Question You Can't Answer

You're spending **$500K–$5M** on AI security tools:
- **Wiz AI** running continuous pentests
- **GitHub Copilot Autofix** auto-remediating vulnerabilities
- **Darktrace AI** handling autonomous threat response
- **AI-powered GRC tools** generating compliance reports

**Board Question:** *"Are these AI investments effective? Show me the data."*

**Current Answer:** *Crickets.* You have no framework to prove it.

**HAIAMM Solution:** Free, open source framework you can use TODAY. Pay only for official certification when you need third-party validation.

## What Security Experts Say

**Bruce Schneier (December 2025)** - World's Leading Security Expert:

> *"Current AI assistants lack foundational trustworthiness and operate without basic integrity controls... we can trust systems we haven't made trustworthy is impossible."*

**HAIAMM is the framework to make AI agents trustworthy.**

## The Problem: AI Agents Run Security, But Nobody Assesses Them

**Traditional Security Era (1990-2024):**
- Humans ran security operations
- ISO 27001, NIST CSF assessed human processes
- ✅ Worked great for 30 years

**AI-Operated Security Era (2025+):**
- **AI agents RUN security** (testing, compliance, training, threat detection)
- AI makes decisions, humans review
- ❌ **No framework exists** to assess AI-operated security maturity

**Result:** You're flying blind while AI agents control critical security decisions.

## HAIAMM: The First Open Source AI-Operated Security Maturity Framework

**Why Open Source?**
- ✅ **Free to use** - No licensing fees, no vendor lock-in
- ✅ **Try before you buy** - Conduct self-assessments, pay only for official certification
- ✅ **Community-driven** - Peer-reviewed, transparent, continuously improving
- ✅ **Industry standard** - Following successful OpenSAMM model
- ✅ **No barriers** - Download and start using immediately

**What HAIAMM Assesses:**

✅ **Effectiveness**: Do your AI security testing agents actually find real vulnerabilities?
✅ **Coordination**: Are your AI security agents creating gaps at boundaries?
✅ **Governance**: Can humans override AI agent decisions when needed?
✅ **Security**: Are the AI agents themselves secured against adversarial manipulation?
✅ **ROI**: Are AI security investments aligned with business risk?

**What Makes It Different:**

| Traditional Frameworks | HAIAMM |
|----------------------|--------|
| **NIST AI RMF**: "Is your AI system secure?" | **"Is your AI-operated security program effective?"** |
| **ISO 27001**: Human-operated controls | **AI agent orchestration & oversight** |
| **OWASP SAMM**: Software security (pre-AI) | **AI agent maturity across 12 security practices** |

## Why This Matters RIGHT NOW

### 1. **Regulatory Pressure (2026-2027)**
- **EU AI Act** (June 2026): Requires human oversight of AI making "critical security decisions"
- **Cyber Insurance** (2027+): Will require proof of AI security maturity
- **HAIAMM certification** = compliance evidence + insurance discount

### 2. **Accountability Crisis**
**Scenario:** AI testing agent misses critical RCE. Breach occurs. $10M loss.

**Without HAIAMM:**
- ❌ No framework for AI agent governance
- ❌ Can't prove due diligence
- ❌ Personal liability for CISO/CTO

**With HAIAMM:**
- ✅ "We assessed our AI security operations at HAIAMM Level 2"
- ✅ "We implemented recommended controls"
- ✅ **Demonstrates reasonable care**

### 3. **AI Failure Scales Catastrophically**
- Human analyst misses vulnerability → 1 system at risk
- **AI testing agent blind spot → 1,200 microservices at risk**
- **One AI mistake = massive breach** (amplified at machine speed)

---

## Real-World Scenarios (2024-2025)

**Healthcare Provider - AI Compliance Agent Hallucination**
- AI GRC agent hallucinated HIPAA compliance evidence for 6 months
- **Cost:** $2M regulatory fine + remediation
- **HAIAMM would have:** Flagged lack of human validation in Policy & Compliance practice

**SaaS Company - AI Testing Agent Blind Spot**
- AI pentest agent missed all GraphQL vulnerabilities (trained only on REST APIs)
- 200+ critical injection vulnerabilities ignored for 9 months
- **Cost:** Breach + technical debt
- **HAIAMM would have:** Identified blind spots in Security Testing practice

**Fintech - Uncoordinated AI Agents**
- 5 AI security agents operated independently, created coverage gaps
- **Cost:** Breach through gap between AI agent responsibilities
- **HAIAMM would have:** Identified coordination issues in Strategy & Metrics practice
