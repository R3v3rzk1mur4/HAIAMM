## SHORT VERSION (3-5 MINUTES)

---

### SCENE 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:20)
**Duration:** 20 seconds

**VISUAL:**
- Dark screen
- Fade in: Modern corporate office / executive boardroom
- Quick cuts showing AI systems in action:
  - AI chatbot interface handling customer inquiries
  - AI document analysis dashboard
  - AI-generated code suggestions
  - AI data analytics and predictions
- Camera zooms out to show CIO/CISO looking at multiple screens
- Executive's expression: concerned, uncertain

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
"You're deploying AI systems across your organization"

**NARRATION:**
"Your organization is implementing AI systems across operations. They're handling customer inquiries, analyzing documents, generating code, and making recommendations. But here's the critical question no one can answer..."

**MUSIC:** Subtle tension building, modern tech sound

---

### SCENE 2: The Critical Question (0:20 - 0:40)
**Duration:** 20 seconds

**VISUAL:**
- Executive in board meeting
- Board members lean forward, expectant
- Question appears on screen in bold
- Executive hesitates, no clear answer

**ON-SCREEN TEXT (ANIMATED):**
**"How do we know our AI implementations are responsible?"**
**"Show us the governance framework."**

**NARRATION:**
"Your board wants assurance. Your auditors need evidence of proper governance. Regulators will demand accountability. But you have no comprehensive framework to demonstrate it. Traditional frameworks weren't designed for AI systems."

**MUSIC:** Tension peak

**B-ROLL:**
- Stock footage of board meetings
- Close-up of hands shuffling through papers
- Empty governance framework diagrams

---

### SCENE 3: The Problem (0:40 - 1:10)
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**VISUAL:**
- Split screen animation:
  - LEFT: Traditional IT (pre-AI era, 1990s-2020)
  - RIGHT: AI-enhanced operations (modern, 2025+)
- Timeline graphic showing evolution:
  - 1990-2020: "Traditional Systems" → ISO 27001, NIST CSF logos
  - 2025+: "AI Systems Everywhere" → Question mark

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:**
"The Fundamental Shift"

**ANIMATED GRAPHICS:**
- ISO 27001 logo fades to grayscale: "Built for traditional IT systems"
- NIST AI RMF logo appears: "Focuses on AI risk management"
- Big red X appears: "NO COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR AI IMPLEMENTATION MATURITY"

**NARRATION:**
"We've entered a new era. AI systems aren't experimental - they're operational. ISO 27001 was designed for traditional IT. NIST AI Risk Management Framework addresses AI risks, but doesn't assess organizational maturity in implementing AI. There's a critical gap in governance, verification, and operational practices."

**MUSIC:** Transition to more urgent tone

---

### SCENE 4: Why This Matters (Higher Stakes) (1:10 - 1:40)
**Duration:** 30 seconds

**VISUAL:**

"Real Scenario (2024): AI System Governance Gap"
"AI chatbot provided harmful medical advice"
"Result: Patient harm, regulatory investigation, reputation damage"

**NARRATION:**
"When AI systems fail without proper governance, the consequences are severe. A healthcare AI chatbot provided incorrect medical guidance because there was no systematic review process. No human oversight. No testing for harmful outputs. Patient was harmed, regulators investigated, millions in fines and reputation damage. This is why governance maturity matters."

**MUSIC:** Dramatic build
