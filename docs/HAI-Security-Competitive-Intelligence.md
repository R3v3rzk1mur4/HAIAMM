## Executive Summary

This report consolidates comprehensive competitive intelligence across four dimensions:
1. Direct AI security competitors (pricing, funding, models)
2. Traditional security vendors and cloud providers entering AI security
3. Business models and emerging vendors
4. Market gaps and strategic positioning

**Key Insight:** All incumbent solutions focus on technical controls (guardrails, model scanning, runtime protection). HAIAMM occupies a unique position as the only framework for Human-AI collaboration security governance maturity. This is complementary, not competitive, positioning.
