- **Differentiation:** Only framework assessing Human-AI collaboration security
- **Recommended Beachhead:** Healthcare (payers) - highest urgency, clearest compliance triggers
- **Target ACV:** $50K-500K depending on company size

## 1. Beachhead Market Decision

### Recommendation: HEALTHCARE (Payers/Integrated Delivery Systems)

#### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Healthcare | Financial Services | Winner |
|----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Regulatory Pressure (Timeline) | HIPAA May 2026, CMS algorithm restrictions | EU AI Act Aug 2026, SEC ongoing | Healthcare (earlier deadline) |
| Buyer Urgency | Critical - Medicare Advantage AI restrictions NOW | High - SEC examination priorities | Healthcare |
| Competitive Gap | Fewer entrenched AI security vendors | More crowded (model risk management) | Healthcare |
| Sales Cycle | 3-6 months (urgent compliance) | 6-12 months (committee-driven) | Healthcare |
| HAIAMM Fit | Perfect - clinical AI needs human-in-loop | Good - trading/lending decisions | Healthcare |
| Market Size | ~6,000 hospitals, ~1,000 payers | ~8,000 banks, ~5,000 investment firms | Tie |

**Total Score:** Healthcare 8/10 vs Financial Services 6/10

#### Why Healthcare Wins

1. **Immediate Regulatory Trigger:** 2026 Medicare Advantage algorithm restrictions already in effect
2. **Higher Stakes:** Clinical AI decisions = life/death, not just financial
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Mandate:** Healthcare regulations explicitly require HITL - perfect HAIAMM fit
4. **Less Competition:** AI security vendors focus on financial services model risk
5. **Faster Sales Cycle:** Compliance deadlines create urgency

#### Financial Services as Phase 2

Don't abandon - enter after establishing healthcare credibility:
- SEC AI examination priorities for 2026 create demand
- Morgan Stanley, Capital One already governance-forward
- Use healthcare success stories to accelerate financial services entry

### Sample Blog Post Outline

**Title:** "Your AI Governance Is Theater: Why Policies Without Measurement Fail"

**Hook (100 words):**
Every enterprise claims to have AI governance. They have policies, review boards, and principles statements. But when the SEC examiner or CMS auditor asks "how mature is your AI governance?" - silence. That's because most AI governance is theater: impressive on stage, empty backstage.

**Section 1: The Governance Illusion (300 words)**
- Statistics: 63% of breached orgs lack AI governance policies
- But 80%+ claim to have governance
- The gap: policies exist, measurement doesn't
- Example: Humana Equal AI pledge vs. 2026 algorithm lawsuit

**Section 2: Why Measurement Matters (300 words)**
- Regulators want evidence, not assertions
- SEC 2026 priorities: "adequate policies AND procedures"
- EU AI Act: Risk management SYSTEM requirements
- Insurance: Cyber insurers asking for AI governance proof

**Section 3: The Maturity Model Approach (300 words)**
- How CMMI transformed software quality
- Why AI governance needs the same evolution
- The 12 practices that matter
- From ad-hoc to optimized

**Section 4: What Good Looks Like (300 words)**
- Level 1: Basic controls exist and are documented
- Level 2: Systematic, measured, organization-wide
- Level 3: Optimized, innovative, transparent
- Self-assessment: Where are you today?
