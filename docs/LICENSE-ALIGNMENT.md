## License Comparison

### OpenSAMM v1.0 Licensing

**OpenSAMM (Open Software Assurance Maturity Model)** uses a dual-license structure:

1. **Framework/Content:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC BY-SA 3.0)
   - SAMM model, methodology, documentation, assessment questions
   - Allows adaptation and commercial use with attribution and share-alike

2. **Software/Tools:** Various open source licenses (MIT, Apache, etc.)
   - Community tools and implementations
   - Free to use, modify, and distribute

**Source:** [OWASP SAMM Official Site](https://www.opensamm.org/)

---

### HAIAMM Licensing

**HAIAMM (Human Assisted Intelligence Assurance Maturity Model)** uses the same dual-license approach:

1. **Framework/Content:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)
   - HAIAMM model, methodology, documentation, assessment content
   - Same freedoms as OpenSAMM with updated CC version

2. **Software/Tools:** MIT License
   - Desktop application, source code, utilities
   - Permissive license for maximum reuse

**Source:** [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file

## Why CC BY-SA 4.0 Instead of 3.0?

**HAIAMM uses CC BY-SA 4.0** (instead of OpenSAMM's 3.0) because:

✅ **Compatibility:** CC BY-SA 4.0 is backward-compatible with 3.0 content
✅ **Improvements:** 4.0 includes better international support and clarity
✅ **Modern Standard:** Recommended by Creative Commons for new projects (2013+)
✅ **Future-Proof:** More robust legal framework for global use

**Creative Commons Position:**
> "Version 4.0 is the most current version of our licenses and is recommended for all new works."

**HAIAMM can legally build upon OpenSAMM v1.0** under CC BY-SA terms, and we comply by:
- ✅ Providing attribution to OpenSAMM v1.0
- ✅ Clearly indicating HAIAMM is derivative/extension work
- ✅ Licensing our framework under compatible CC BY-SA license
- ✅ Maintaining share-alike requirements

## Why Dual Licensing?

**OpenSAMM established this pattern for good reasons:**

1. **Open Framework:** CC BY-SA ensures maturity model remains open and improvable
2. **Flexible Tools:** MIT/permissive licenses allow diverse implementations
3. **Community Growth:** Anyone can contribute, adapt, translate
4. **Commercial Sustainability:** Enables professional services while keeping core free
5. **Attribution Chain:** Maintains lineage and credit for contributors

**HAIAMM follows the same philosophy:**
- Framework remains open for community benefit
- Tools are freely usable in any context
- Professional services can build around it
- Innovation is encouraged
- Attribution is preserved
