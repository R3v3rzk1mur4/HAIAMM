# HAIAMM v2.1 Pilot Implementation Status

**Status:** ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Outcome-Oriented Data Model Created
**Date:** December 15, 2025
**Version:** 2.1-pilot

---

## What Was Accomplished

### Core Achievement
Successfully created **HAIAMM v2.1-pilot** data model with complete outcome-oriented enhancements for three pilot practices in the Software domain:

1. **SM (Strategy & Metrics)** - All 3 maturity levels
2. **ST (Security Testing)** - All 3 maturity levels
3. **TA (Threat Assessment)** - All 3 maturity levels

### Files Created

**1. `/config/haiamm_multi_domain_data_v2.1.json`**
- Enhanced data model with v2.1 structure for pilot practices
- File size: ~5,500 lines
- Valid JSON syntax ✓
- All other practices remain in v2.0 structure (for future enhancement)

**2. `/scripts/enhance_to_v21_pilot.py`**
- Python script (1,450+ lines) for automated enhancement
- Implements complete v2.1 structure for SM, ST, TA practices
- Reusable for expanding to other practices/domains

---

## V2.1 Enhancement Structure

Each enhanced practice level now includes:

### 1. **Objective** (Enhanced)
Clear, actionable goal statement for the maturity level

**Example (SM Level 1):**
> "Establish foundational understanding and oversight of AI security operations across the organization"

### 2. **Activities** (Enhanced)
3-5 specific, concrete actions to achieve the objective

**Example (SM Level 1):**
- Create comprehensive inventory of all AI security agents
- Define organizational risk tolerance for AI-operated security
- Establish executive sponsorship for AI security program
- Implement basic metrics tracking AI agent activities

### 3. **Assessment Criteria** (Significantly Enhanced)
Questions with detailed verification procedures, evidence requirements, and scoring rubrics

**Example Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "sm-1-1",
  "question": "Do you have a documented strategy for AI security operations?",
  "verification": [
    "Review AI security strategy document (must be <12 months old)",
    "Verify document includes: AI agent inventory, risk tolerance, governance structure",
    "Interview executive sponsor to confirm awareness and engagement",
    "Check if strategy is communicated to relevant teams"
  ],
  "evidence": [
    "AI security strategy document with approval signatures",
    "AI agent inventory spreadsheet/database",
    "Executive sponsor assignment documentation",
    "Meeting minutes from quarterly executive reviews"
  ],
  "scoring": {
    "yes_if": "Document exists, is current (<12mo), includes required elements, has executive sponsor",
    "partial_if": "Document exists but missing elements or outdated",
    "no_if": "No documented strategy or >12 months old"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Success Metrics** (NEW)
4-5 quantifiable metrics with specific targets and measurement methodologies

**Example (SM Level 1):**
```json
{
  "metric": "AI Agent Inventory Completeness",
  "target": ">80% of AI security agents documented",
  "measurement": "(Documented AI agents / Total deployed AI agents) × 100",
  "data_source": "AI agent inventory database + IT asset management",
  "frequency": "Quarterly",
  "baseline": "Conduct initial discovery to establish baseline",
  "validation": "Cross-check with vendor licenses, cloud service logs, security tool inventory"
}
```

**Anti-Gaming Features:**
- Specific measurement formulas (can't fake)
- Required data sources (must have real data)
- Validation procedures (independent verification)
- Baseline requirements (must track over time)

### 5. **Desired Outcomes** (NEW)
3-5 business/security outcomes achieved at this maturity level

**Example (SM Level 1):**
- Leadership Accountability: C-suite understands what AI agents are doing security work
- Risk-Based Oversight: AI security activities categorized by risk level with appropriate human oversight
- Measurement Foundation: Basic visibility into AI security agent activities
- Inventory Clarity: Organization knows which AI agents operate security functions

### 6. **Implementation** (NEW)
Time/effort/cost estimates and resource requirements

**Example (SM Level 1):**
```json
{
  "time": "1-2 months",
  "effort_hours": "40-80 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "ai_agent_inventory": "16-24 hours (discovery, documentation)",
    "strategy_development": "16-24 hours (stakeholder input, drafting)",
    "executive_engagement": "4-8 hours (briefings, approvals)",
    "metrics_setup": "8-16 hours (dashboard configuration)",
    "validation": "4-8 hours (review, testing)"
  },
  "cost_internal": "$8K-$16K (at $200/hr loaded cost)",
  "cost_external": "$15K-$30K (consultant-led strategy development)",
  "roles_required": [
    "CISO or security leader (strategy ownership)",
    "Security operations manager (inventory, metrics)",
    "Risk management (risk classification)",
    "Executive sponsor (governance, oversight)"
  ]
}
```

### 7. **Common Pitfalls** (NEW)
Real-world mistakes to avoid

**Example (SM Level 1):**
- Incomplete Inventory: Missing shadow AI tools, not including planned agents
- Strategy Without Teeth: Beautiful document nobody follows, no enforcement
- Risk Classification Too Broad: All agents marked "medium risk"
- Metrics Theater: Tracking vanity metrics instead of effectiveness

### 8. **Tools & Resources** (NEW)
Specific tools, frameworks, and references

**Example (SM Level 1):**
- Asset management platforms (ServiceNow, Jira)
- Cloud service discovery (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph)
- BI/Dashboard tools (Tableau, Power BI, Grafana)
- Reference: OpenSAMM v1.0 Strategy & Metrics, NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 42001

## How This Addresses Maturity Model Criticisms

### Criticism #1: "Checkbox Compliance"
**Solution:** Success metrics with specific measurement formulas make checkbox compliance impossible
- Can't claim ">80% inventory completeness" without actual data
- Validation procedures require independent verification
- Scoring rubrics differentiate between yes/partial/no

### Criticism #2: "One Size Fits All"
**Solution:** Implementation guidance scales by organization size
- Internal cost estimates: $8K-$100K depending on level
- External cost estimates: $15K-$300K for consultant support
- Time estimates: 1-12 months based on maturity level
- Role requirements adapt to organization structure

### Criticism #3: "Assessment Theater"
**Solution:** Action-oriented with implementation roadmap
- Each level has concrete time/effort/cost estimates
- Success metrics track progress (not just "Level 2 achieved")
- Desired outcomes articulate business value
- Common pitfalls help avoid implementation failures

### Criticism #4: "Backward-Looking"
**Solution:** Built for AI-operated security (forward-focused)
- Assesses AI agent effectiveness, not just human processes
- Includes AI-specific threats (prompt injection, model poisoning)
- Predictive metrics (Level 3 TA: ">60% threat prediction accuracy")

### Criticism #5: "No Proof of ROI"
**Solution:** ROI-demonstrable through metrics
- **SM Level 2:** "AI Agent Effectiveness - True Positive Rate >70%"
- **SM Level 3:** "Demonstrable ROI: >3:1 risk reduction to investment ratio"
- **ST Level 2:** "False Negative Rate <15%"
- Before/after comparison enables ROI calculation

## Next Steps (Week 5-8 from Pilot Plan)

### Week 5-6: Create Assessment Guidance
**Status:** Not Started
**Deliverable:** Assessor guide for outcome-based validation

**Tasks:**
1. Document verification procedures for success metrics
2. Create evidence collection templates
3. Write scoring rubrics (yes/partial/no criteria)
4. Develop training materials for assessors

**Why Important:**
Assessors need clear guidance on HOW to verify success metrics and collect evidence. Without this, even the best data model won't be consistently applied.

### Week 7-8: Pilot Assessment
**Status:** Not Started
**Deliverable:** Completed pilot assessment using outcome-oriented approach

**Tasks:**
1. Conduct assessment with 1-2 pilot organizations
2. Collect success metrics data
3. Validate metrics are measurable in practice
4. Refine based on pilot feedback
5. Document lessons learned

**Why Important:**
Real-world testing validates that success metrics are:
- Actually measurable (organizations have the data)
- Achievable (targets are realistic)
- Valuable (outcomes resonate with stakeholders)

### Post-Pilot: Expand to Remaining Practices
**Status:** Not Started
**Timeline:** Weeks 9-16

**Tasks:**
1. Apply v2.1 template to remaining 9 practices (PC, EG, SA, SR, DR, CR, IM, EH, ML)
2. Expand from Software domain to other 5 domains (Infrastructure, Endpoints, Data, Processes, Vendors)
3. Update complete data model (all 72 practice-domain combinations)
4. Train assessors on outcome-based methodology
5. Launch HAIAMM v2.1 publicly

---

## Technical Debt / Known Limitations

### 1. Only Software Domain Enhanced
**Current:** SM, ST, TA enhanced in Software domain only
**Remaining:** 63 practice-domain combinations still in v2.0 structure

**Impact:** Organizations assessing non-Software domains won't get outcome-oriented benefits yet

**Resolution:** Apply same enhancement pattern to other domains (Infrastructure, Endpoints, Data, Processes, Vendors)

### 2. Remaining 9 Practices Not Enhanced
**Current:** SM, ST, TA enhanced (3 of 12 practices)
**Remaining:** PC, EG, SA, SR, DR, CR, IM, EH, ML (9 practices)

**Impact:** Organizations need these practices for comprehensive assessment

**Resolution:**
- Reuse enhancement script template
- Extract specifications from v2.1-PILOT-PRACTICES.md (already has templates)
- Estimate 2-3 weeks per practice for quality enhancement

### 3. No Assessor Training Materials Yet
**Current:** Enhanced data model exists, but no assessor guide

**Impact:** Assessors won't know HOW to verify success metrics or collect evidence

**Resolution:** Create assessor guide (Week 5-6 task above)

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 (Week 3-4) of the v2.1 pilot implementation is complete.**

The HAIAMM v2.1-pilot data model successfully demonstrates the outcome-oriented enhancement approach for three pilot practices (SM, ST, TA) in the Software domain. The enhanced structure addresses all five major criticisms of traditional maturity models through:

1. **Measurable success metrics** (anti-checkbox compliance)
2. **Flexible implementation guidance** (anti-one-size-fits-all)
3. **Action-oriented roadmaps** (anti-assessment theater)
4. **AI-focused, forward-looking** (anti-backward-looking)
5. **ROI-demonstrable metrics** (anti-no-proof-of-roi)

**Next critical milestone:** Week 5-6 (Assessor Guide Creation) to enable pilot assessments in Week 7-8.
