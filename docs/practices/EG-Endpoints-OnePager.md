# Education & Guidance (EG)
## Endpoints Domain - HAIAMM v2.0

---

### Practice Overview

**Objective:** Establish and maintain education and guidance programs that enable users and IT teams to effectively work with AI-operated endpoint security

**Description:** Build and deliver training, awareness programs, and reference materials that enable end users, IT support teams, and security teams to understand, cooperate with, and optimize AI-driven endpoint security. Ensure users understand what AI endpoint security monitors, how to respond to AI security actions, and privacy protections while building security culture and reducing security friction.

**Context:** Organizations deploying AI-operated endpoint security (EDR/XDR, AI-driven patch management, automated device compliance) face unique education challenges - end users must understand what AI monitors without feeling surveilled, IT teams must learn AI-augmented endpoint management, and everyone must cooperate with AI security actions (quarantine, patching, compliance enforcement) without business disruption. Effective education balances security effectiveness, user productivity, and privacy trust.

## Common Pitfalls

**Level 1:**
- ❌ Training is compliance checkbox (mandatory once-per-year boring training, no engagement or behavior change)
- ❌ Fear-based messaging (scare tactics create anxiety not security-conscious behavior)
- ❌ Surveillance concerns ignored (don't address employee privacy fears, erode trust in AI endpoint security)
- ❌ No measurement (don't track whether training changes behavior or just completion rates)
- ❌ Training disconnected from reality (generic content not relevant to actual threats organization faces)

**Level 2:**
- ❌ Phishing simulations are punitive (trick users then punish them, creates resentment not learning)
- ❌ Role-based training too rigid (doesn't account for cross-functional roles or job evolution)
- ❌ Self-service resources are hard to find (extensive knowledge base that users can't discover when needed)
- ❌ Training overload (too frequent mandatory training, users fatigued and disengage)
- ❌ IT team training neglected (focus on end users, don't adequately train IT support on AI endpoint security)

**Level 3:**
- ❌ Gamification becomes competitive burden (leaderboards create stress not engagement)
- ❌ Security champions burnout (volunteers overwhelmed, no support or recognition, abandon role)
- ❌ External contributions prioritized over internal effectiveness (focus on industry recognition while internal security culture lags)
- ❌ Metrics measure activity not security (track training hours not actual risk reduction or behavior change)
- ❌ Continuous learning becomes training fatigue (too many microlearning prompts, users tune out)
