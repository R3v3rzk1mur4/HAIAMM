# Education & Guidance (EG)
## Infrastructure Domain - HAIAMM v2.0

---

### Practice Overview

**Objective:** Establish and maintain education and guidance programs that enable teams to effectively operate AI-driven infrastructure security

**Description:** Build and deliver training, awareness programs, and reference materials that enable infrastructure teams, security teams, and stakeholders to understand, operate, and optimize AI-driven infrastructure security. Ensure teams have the knowledge to leverage AI security capabilities effectively while understanding limitations, avoiding over-reliance, and maintaining human oversight.

**Context:** Organizations adopting AI-operated infrastructure security face a learning curve - teams must understand how AI tools work, when to trust AI recommendations, when to override AI decisions, and how to tune AI systems for effectiveness. Without proper education, teams may misuse AI tools, ignore valuable AI insights, or place inappropriate trust in AI decisions. Effective education programs accelerate AI adoption, reduce errors, and maximize security value.

## Common Pitfalls

**Level 1:**
- ❌ Training is one-time event not ongoing program (initial training only, no refreshers as tools evolve)
- ❌ Training focuses on tool mechanics not effective usage (how to click buttons, not when to trust AI or override decisions)
- ❌ No executive awareness (leadership doesn't understand AI security value, fails to support adoption)
- ❌ Awareness campaigns are generic security messaging (don't specifically address AI capabilities and value)
- ❌ No training effectiveness tracking (don't know if training is reaching teams or changing behavior)

**Level 2:**
- ❌ Labs use toy examples not realistic scenarios (labs don't reflect actual infrastructure security challenges teams face)
- ❌ Guidance materials become outdated (runbooks not updated when AI tools change, documentation drift)
- ❌ Role-based training is too rigid (doesn't account for cross-functional teams or evolving roles)
- ❌ Training is mandatory checkbox (teams complete training but don't apply knowledge)
- ❌ Guidance materials are comprehensive but not discoverable (extensive documentation that no one can find when needed)

**Level 3:**
- ❌ Community of practice has low engagement (meetings scheduled but poorly attended, limited participation)
- ❌ External contributions prioritized over internal effectiveness (focus on conference talks while internal teams lack training)
- ❌ Training metrics measure activity not outcomes (track training hours, not behavior change or security improvements)
- ❌ Continuous learning becomes training overhead (too many sessions, teams fatigued, participation declines)
- ❌ Industry contributions are performative (publish generic content, don't share real learnings and challenges)

## Training & Awareness Considerations

Effective AI infrastructure security education must address several unique challenges:

### Technical Complexity
- **AI/ML Fundamentals**: Teams need basic understanding of how AI works (not deep ML expertise, but enough to understand capabilities and limitations)
- **Explainability**: Training must help teams understand why AI makes specific recommendations (not "black box" acceptance)
- **Tool Diversity**: Multiple AI tools with different capabilities require comprehensive tool-specific training

### Human-AI Collaboration
- **Appropriate Trust**: Training must calibrate appropriate trust in AI (not blind trust or total skepticism)
- **Override Decisions**: Clear guidance on when humans should override AI recommendations
- **Escalation Procedures**: Teams need to know when to escalate AI findings to human experts

### Organizational Change
- **Workflow Changes**: AI changes how infrastructure security work is done, requiring workflow adaptation training
- **Role Evolution**: Jobs evolve with AI automation, requiring reskilling and career development guidance
- **Resistance Management**: Some team members may resist AI, requiring change management and awareness building

### Continuous Learning
- **Rapid AI Evolution**: AI tools evolve quickly, requiring frequent training updates and continuous learning culture
- **Emerging Threats**: New attack techniques against AI require ongoing threat awareness education
- **Best Practice Evolution**: Industry best practices for AI infrastructure security are still emerging, requiring continuous learning

Organizations must invest in comprehensive, ongoing education to realize the full value of AI-operated infrastructure security.
