# Education & Guidance (EG)
## Processes Domain - HAIAMM v2.0

---

### Practice Overview

**Objective:** Establish and maintain education and guidance programs that enable teams to effectively operate AI-automated security processes and workflows

**Description:** Build and deliver training, awareness programs, and reference materials that enable security operations teams, compliance teams, and stakeholders to understand, operate, and optimize AI-automated security processes. Ensure teams understand how AI automates incident response, compliance reporting, vulnerability management, and metrics tracking while maintaining quality, accountability, and continuous improvement.

**Context:** Organizations automating security processes with AI face workflow transformation - teams must learn new AI-augmented workflows, understand when to trust AI process automation, maintain quality oversight of AI-generated outputs, and continuously tune AI processes for effectiveness. Without proper education, teams may misuse automated processes, lose accountability, or fail to optimize AI capabilities. Effective education ensures AI process automation enhances security operations rather than creating new risks.

## Common Pitfalls

**Level 1:**
- ❌ Training focuses on tools not workflows (teach tool features, not how workflows change with AI)
- ❌ No accountability training (teams don't understand they're still responsible for AI-automated process quality)
- ❌ Process automation treated as black box (teams don't understand how AI processes work, can't troubleshoot or optimize)
- ❌ Training ignores workflow disruption (don't prepare teams for how AI changes their day-to-day work)
- ❌ No quality standards communicated (teams don't know what "good" looks like for AI-automated outputs)

**Level 2:**
- ❌ Hands-on scenarios are too simple (basic happy-path examples, don't reflect real workflow complexity)
- ❌ Process documentation becomes outdated (runbooks don't reflect current AI capabilities or workflow changes)
- ❌ Quality assurance is inconsistent (ad-hoc sampling, no systematic QA, quality issues undetected)
- ❌ Training doesn't cover process failures (don't teach what to do when AI processes fail or produce errors)
- ❌ ITIL integration is superficial (claim ITIL alignment, but AI workflows don't actually follow ITIL processes)

**Level 3:**
- ❌ Process community has low engagement (meetings scheduled but poorly attended, limited participation)
- ❌ External contributions prioritized over internal effectiveness (focus on conference talks while internal processes need improvement)
- ❌ Process metrics measure activity not outcomes (track number of automated incidents, not quality or actual efficiency gains)
- ❌ Continuous learning becomes meeting overhead (too many process review meetings, teams fatigued)
- ❌ Over-automation reduces human capability (teams can't operate processes manually if AI fails, lost skills)
