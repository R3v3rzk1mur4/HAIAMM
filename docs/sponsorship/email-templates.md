## 1. Cold Outreach — Security Vendors

**Subject:** Open Source AI Security Standard — Sponsorship Opportunity

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company] is at the forefront of AI-powered security, and I think you'd be interested in HAIAMM.

**The problem:** AI agents now run security operations—threat detection, vulnerability remediation, compliance automation. But there's no standard way to assess if they're actually effective.

**The solution:** HAIAMM (Human Assisted Intelligence Assurance Maturity Model) is the first open source framework specifically for AI-operated security assessment. It's already aligned with OWASP Top 10 for LLM and Agentic Applications.

**Why this matters to [Company]:**
- Your customers need to demonstrate AI security governance (EU AI Act, insurance requirements)
- An open standard benefits the entire ecosystem—including your products
- Early sponsors shape the framework's direction

We're seeking founding sponsors to support development. Benefits include Technical Advisory Board seats, co-development rights, and prominent recognition.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore alignment?

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** HAIAMM is 100% open source. We're building the industry standard, not a competitor.

## 2. Cold Outreach — Enterprise Security Teams

**Subject:** How do you measure your AI security tools' effectiveness?

---

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How do you know if your AI security agents are actually working?

Darktrace blocks threats. Copilot fixes vulnerabilities. AI tools generate compliance evidence. But when the board asks "Can you prove our AI security is effective?"—what do you show them?

**HAIAMM** answers that question. It's an open source maturity framework for AI-operated security programs—12 practices, 6 domains, measurable outcomes aligned with OWASP standards.

Organizations using HAIAMM can:
- Objectively measure AI security maturity (not just vendor claims)
- Demonstrate due diligence for audits and insurance
- Identify gaps before they become incidents

We're seeking sponsors to support continued development. Corporate sponsorship starts at $5K/year and includes training, early access, and input on the roadmap.

Interested in learning more?

[Your Name]

## 3. Cold Outreach — Consulting Firms

**Subject:** New Service Line Opportunity — AI Security Maturity Assessment

---

Hi [Name],

Your clients are deploying AI agents across their security programs. Soon they'll need to prove those systems are effective—for audits, insurance, and regulatory compliance (EU AI Act enforcement begins June 2026).

**HAIAMM** is the framework they'll use. It's the first open source maturity model for AI-operated security, with 432 assessment questions and full OWASP alignment.

**Opportunity for [Firm]:**
- Offer HAIAMM assessments as a service
- Train your team as certified assessors
- Differentiate with cutting-edge AI security expertise

We're building a partner ecosystem and seeking sponsors. Silver sponsorship ($15K) includes 3 assessor training seats and advisory input on the framework.

Would a partnership conversation make sense?

[Your Name]

## 4. Warm Outreach — Conference Connection

**Subject:** Following up from [Conference] — HAIAMM Sponsorship

---

**What sponsors get:**

- Train your team (included seats by tier)
- Demonstrate thought leadership (speaking opportunities, co-branded content)
- Support the ecosystem your products depend on

I've attached our sponsorship overview. Would next week work for a deeper conversation?

## Tips for Outreach

1. **Personalize the opening** — Reference their product, recent news, or conference connection
2. **Lead with their problem** — Not your solution
3. **Keep it short** — Under 150 words for cold outreach
4. **One CTA** — Ask for a call OR send information, not both
5. **Follow up** — 80% of deals happen after the 5th contact
6. **Track everything** — Use a CRM or spreadsheet to manage pipeline
