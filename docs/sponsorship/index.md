# Become a HAIAMM Sponsor

**Support the Open Standard for AI Security Maturity**

---

## Why Sponsor HAIAMM?

AI agents are no longer just being secured—they ARE the security program. Darktrace blocks threats autonomously. GitHub Copilot auto-merges security fixes. AI GRC tools generate compliance evidence.

**HAIAMM (Human Assisted Intelligence Assurance Maturity Model)** is the first open source framework to assess whether AI-operated security is actually effective.

Your sponsorship directly supports:

- **Open Standards** — Framework development without vendor lock-in
- **Community Growth** — Documentation, translations, accessibility
- **Research & Validation** — Empirical benchmarking and academic partnerships
- **Industry Adoption** — Training, certifications, and case studies
