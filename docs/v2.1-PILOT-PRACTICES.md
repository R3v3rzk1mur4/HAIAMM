# HAIAMM v2.0 Pilot Practices: Outcome-Oriented Specifications

**Status:** Draft for Review and Validation
**Practices:** Strategy & Metrics (SM), Security Testing (ST), Threat Assessment (TA)
**Domain:** Software (template for other 5 domains)
**Version:** 2.0-pilot

---

## Practice 1: SM - Strategy & Metrics (Governance)

### Context

**What this practice assesses:**
The organization's ability to strategically manage HAI security programs and measure their effectiveness.

**Why outcomes matter here:**
Without measurable outcomes, organizations can claim "we have a strategy" while AI security agents operate without accountability, alignment, or demonstrable value.

**AI-Operated Security Context:**
- AI agents making security decisions (testing, threat detection, compliance)
- Need to align AI operations with business risk
- Need to prove AI security investments deliver value
- Need metrics that show AI agents are effective (not just active)

---

### SM Level 1: Establish AI Security Governance Foundation

**Objective:**
Establish foundational understanding and oversight of HAI security operations across the organization.

**Activities:**
1. Create comprehensive inventory of all AI security agents (deployed and planned)
   - Include: Agent name, function, vendor, data sources, decision authority
   - Document: What security decisions each agent makes autonomously

2. Define organizational risk tolerance for HAI security
   - Identify: High-risk vs. low-risk security functions
   - Determine: Which decisions require human approval vs. AI autonomy

3. Establish executive sponsorship for HAI security program
   - Assign: C-level or VP-level owner for HAI security operations
   - Schedule: Quarterly executive reviews of AI security effectiveness

4. Implement basic metrics tracking AI agent activities
   - Track: Number of security decisions made by AI agents
   - Monitor: Coverage (what % of security operations are AI-assisted/operated)
   - Measure: Basic usage statistics (uptime, utilization)

**Assessment Criteria:**

  ]
}
```

**Desired Outcomes:**

1. **Leadership Accountability**
   - C-suite and senior leadership understand what AI agents are doing security work
   - Clear ownership and sponsorship for HAI security program
   - HAI security operations are visible at executive level (not hidden in IT)

2. **Risk-Based Oversight**
   - AI security activities are categorized by risk level
   - High-risk decisions have appropriate human oversight
   - Organization can articulate risk tolerance for AI autonomy

3. **Measurement Foundation**
   - Basic visibility into AI security agent activities
   - Foundation for tracking effectiveness (beyond just activity)
   - Data collection infrastructure for future maturity improvements

4. **Inventory Clarity**
   - Organization knows which AI agents are operating security functions
   - No "shadow AI" security tools deployed without governance
   - Basis for strategic planning and resource allocation

**Typical Implementation:**

```json
{
  "time": "1-2 months",
  "effort_hours": "40-80 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "ai_agent_inventory": "16-24 hours (discovery, documentation)",
    "strategy_development": "16-24 hours (stakeholder input, drafting)",
    "executive_engagement": "4-8 hours (briefings, approvals)",
    "metrics_setup": "8-16 hours (dashboard configuration)",
    "validation": "4-8 hours (review, testing)"
  },
  "cost_internal": "$8K-$16K (at $200/hr loaded cost)",
  "cost_external": "$15K-$30K (consultant-led strategy development)",
  "roles_required": [
    "CISO or security leader (strategy ownership)",
    "Security operations manager (inventory, metrics)",
    "Risk management (risk classification)",
    "Executive sponsor (governance, oversight)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Incomplete Inventory**
   - Missing "shadow AI" tools (teams using AI without IT approval)
   - Not including planned/pilot AI agents (only tracking production)
   - Forgetting AI features in existing tools (e.g., SIEM with AI threat detection)
   - **Solution:** Broad discovery including surveys, license audits, cloud service reviews

2. **Strategy Without Teeth**
   - Beautiful strategy document that nobody follows
   - No enforcement mechanism or accountability
   - Metrics tracked but never reviewed or acted upon
   - **Solution:** Tie to existing governance (board reporting, audit requirements), executive KPIs

3. **Risk Classification Too Broad**
   - All AI agents marked "medium risk" (avoiding hard decisions)
   - No clear criteria for risk levels
   - Risk tolerance not actually enforced
   - **Solution:** Use specific criteria (financial impact, data sensitivity, regulatory)

4. **Metrics Theater**
   - Tracking vanity metrics (# of AI agents) not effectiveness
   - Metrics that always look good (cherry-picked)
   - No baseline for comparison
   - **Solution:** Focus on outcome metrics (vulnerability discovery rate, false positives)

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **AI Agent Inventory Tools:**
   - Asset management platforms (ServiceNow, Jira)
   - Cloud service discovery (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph)
   - SaaS management platforms (BetterCloud, Zylo)

2. **Metrics Tracking:**
   - BI/Dashboard tools (Tableau, Power BI, Grafana)
   - Security metrics platforms (CISO Dashboards, SecurityScorecard)
   - Spreadsheet templates (for startups)

3. **Reference Frameworks:**
   - OpenSAMM v1.0 Strategy & Metrics practice
   - NIST CSF (Governance function)
   - ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system)

4. **Example Documents:**
   - AI Security Strategy Template
   - AI Agent Inventory Spreadsheet
   - Risk Classification Matrix

### SM Level 2: Risk-Aligned AI Security Strategy

**Objective:**
Align AI security agent operations with business risk priorities and measure effectiveness (not just activity).

**Activities:**

1. Classify AI security agents by criticality and business impact
   - Map each AI agent to business processes/assets it protects
   - Score impact: High (critical systems), Medium (important), Low (non-critical)
   - Document dependencies: What breaks if this AI agent fails?

2. Map AI agent activities to business risk areas
   - Identify top 10 business risks (financial, regulatory, operational)
   - Assess which risks are covered by AI security agents
   - Identify gaps: Risks without AI coverage or over-invested areas

3. Establish effectiveness KPIs (not just activity metrics)
   - True positive rate: % of AI-reported issues that are real
   - False negative rate: % of real issues AI agents miss
   - Coverage: % of attack surface monitored by AI
   - Time-to-detection: How fast AI agents find vulnerabilities
   - Remediation impact: Issues fixed based on AI recommendations

4. Create AI security ROI dashboard for leadership
   - Cost of AI security tools vs. value delivered
   - Risk reduction quantified (e.g., vulnerabilities prevented)
   - Comparison to manual security operations costs
   - Trend analysis: Improving or declining effectiveness?

5. Implement regular strategy reviews with stakeholders
   - Quarterly reviews: CISO, CTO, risk management, business leaders
   - Review: Effectiveness metrics, gaps, investment decisions
   - Adjust: Reallocate resources based on ROI data

}
```

**Desired Outcomes:**

1. **Risk-Driven Investment**
   - AI security spending prioritized by business risk (not vendor hype)
   - High-risk areas have appropriate AI coverage
   - Low-value areas not over-invested
   - Can justify AI security budget with risk data

2. **Measurable Effectiveness**
   - Know which AI agents are performing well vs. poorly
   - Track improvement over time (or identify declining performance)
   - Data-driven decisions about AI tool renewal/replacement
   - Can answer: "Is AI security working?"

3. **Board-Ready Metrics**
   - Executive dashboards showing AI security value
   - Clear ROI story: "Spent $X, reduced risk by $Y"
   - Comparison to industry benchmarks (if available)
   - Confidence in reporting AI security posture to board

4. **Strategic Alignment**
   - HAI security operations aligned with business objectives
   - Security goals reflect business priorities
   - Regular engagement between security and business leadership
   - AI security seen as business enabler, not cost center

**Typical Implementation:**

```json
{
  "time": "3-6 months",
  "effort_hours": "150-250 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "risk_classification": "40-60 hours (business process mapping, impact analysis)",
    "metrics_development": "40-60 hours (effectiveness metrics definition, dashboard build)",
    "roi_framework": "30-50 hours (risk quantification, cost analysis)",
    "stakeholder_engagement": "20-40 hours (quarterly reviews, presentations)",
    "continuous_monitoring": "20-40 hours (monthly metrics review, trend analysis)"
  },
  "cost_internal": "$30K-$50K (at $200/hr loaded cost)",
  "cost_external": "$50K-$100K (consultant-led transformation with tools)",
  "roles_required": [
    "CISO (strategy ownership, board reporting)",
    "Security operations lead (effectiveness metrics)",
    "Risk management (risk quantification)",
    "Finance (ROI calculation, budget alignment)",
    "Business leaders (risk prioritization input)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Vanity Metrics**
   - Tracking only metrics that look good (# of vulnerabilities found)
   - Ignoring metrics that reveal problems (false positive rate, missed vulnerabilities)
   - Cherry-picking data to show success
   - **Solution:** Balanced scorecard approach, include "negative" metrics, independent validation

2. **No Baseline**
   - Reporting current metrics without historical comparison
   - Can't show improvement or decline
   - Impossible to prove ROI without before/after data
   - **Solution:** Establish baseline before claiming improvement, track trends over time

3. **Risk Classification Theater**
   - Everything marked "high risk" (avoiding trade-offs)
   - Or everything "medium risk" (avoiding accountability)
   - Risk ratings not actually used for decisions
   - **Solution:** Force-rank top 20% as high-risk, use tiering for resource allocation

4. **Metrics Without Action**
   - Dashboards created but never reviewed
   - Poor performance identified but not addressed
   - Metrics presented to executives who don't act
   - **Solution:** Tie metrics to accountability, establish triggers for action

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Risk Quantification:**
   - FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
   - Risk registers/heat maps
   - Business impact analysis tools

2. **Effectiveness Tracking:**
   - Security metrics platforms (CISO Dash, Panaseer)
   - Custom BI dashboards (Tableau, Power BI)
   - AI agent vendor dashboards (synthesize into unified view)

3. **ROI Calculation:**
   - Risk-based ROI calculators
   - Threat modeling tools (for risk quantification)
   - Cost-benefit analysis templates

4. **Benchmarking:**
   - HAIAMM community benchmarking database (when available)
   - Industry reports (Forrester, Gartner on AI security)
   - Peer networks (CIS benchmarks, SANS)

   - Collect peer data: AI security spend as % of security budget
   - Compare effectiveness: Our true positive rate vs. industry average
   - Identify best practices from top performers

2. Correlate AI security investments with actual risk reduction outcomes
   - Track: Vulnerabilities prevented, incidents avoided, time saved
   - Quantify: Risk reduction in dollars (using FAIR or similar)
   - Analyze: Which AI security investments deliver best ROI?
   - Optimize: Reallocate budget from low-ROI to high-ROI tools

3. Optimize AI agent portfolio based on effectiveness and ROI data

    "Data analyst/scientist (predictive analytics, correlation analysis)",
    "Finance (ROI validation, budget optimization)",
    "Risk management (risk quantification, validation)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Benchmarking Bias**
   - Only compare against weaker peers (to look good)
   - Cherry-pick favorable metrics for comparison
   - Not comparing like-for-like (different industry, size, risk)
   - **Solution:** Compare against aspirational peers, use third-party benchmarking, multiple metrics

2. **ROI Fabrication**
   - Claiming risk reduction without evidence
   - Counting "prevented breaches" that may not have happened
   - Overstating benefits, understating costs
   - **Solution:** Conservative assumptions, external validation, auditable methodology

3. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Too much data collection, not enough action
   - Optimization studies that never result in decisions
   - Perfect being enemy of good
   - **Solution:** Set decision deadlines, "good enough" data threshold, bias to action

4. **Predictive Inaccuracy**
   - Forecasts based on flawed assumptions
   - Not updating forecasts as conditions change
   - Ignoring external factors (new threats, regulations)
   - **Solution:** Regular forecast updates, scenario planning, incorporate external intelligence

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Benchmarking Platforms:**
   - HAIAMM community benchmarking database (when launched)
   - Industry benchmark reports (Gartner, Forrester, SANS)
   - Peer networks (invite-only CISOs groups)

2. **Optimization Tools:**
   - Portfolio management software
   - ROI calculators
   - Decision analysis frameworks (multi-criteria decision analysis)

3. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Business intelligence tools with forecasting (Power BI, Tableau)
   - Statistical analysis software (R, Python)
   - AI/ML for trend prediction

4. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Incident management platforms (ServiceNow, Jira)
   - Lessons learned databases
   - AI agent performance dashboards with alerting

## Practice 2: ST - Security Testing (Verification)

### Context

**What this practice assesses:**
The organization's ability to verify that AI security agents actually find real vulnerabilities and cannot be adversarially manipulated.

**Why outcomes matter here:**
AI testing agents can report thousands of "vulnerabilities" while missing real critical issues. Outcome focus ensures testing is EFFECTIVE, not just ACTIVE.

**AI-Operated Security Context:**
- AI agents running automated pentests, vulnerability scans, code analysis
- Need to verify AI agents find REAL vulnerabilities (true positives)
- Need to ensure AI agents don't miss critical issues (false negatives)
- Need to test if attackers can trick AI agents (adversarial resilience)

---

### ST Level 1: Basic AI Security Testing

**Objective:**
Establish foundational capability to test AI security agents and validate their findings.

**Activities:**

1. Implement basic validation process for AI-reported vulnerabilities
   - Sample 10-20 AI-reported issues monthly
   - Manual verification: Is this a real vulnerability?
   - Track true positive vs. false positive rate
   - Document validation findings

2. Test AI security agents with known vulnerabilities
   - Create test environment with intentional vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP WebGoat)
   - Run AI testing agents against known vulns
   - Measure: Did AI agents find them? (Detection rate)
   - Identify blind spots: Which vulns did AI miss?

3. Establish baseline metrics for AI agent effectiveness
   - True positive rate: % of AI findings that are real
   - False positive rate: % of AI findings that are false alarms
   - Detection rate: % of known vulnerabilities AI found
   - Document baseline for future improvement tracking

4. Create feedback loop to AI agent vendors/developers
   - Report false positives to vendor (reduce noise)
   - Request coverage for missed vulnerability types
   - Track vendor responsiveness and improvements
   - Document workarounds for AI agent limitations

**Assessment Criteria:**

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {
      "id": "st-1-1",
      "question": "Do you perform basic security testing using AI agents?",
      "verification": [

      }
    },
    {
      "id": "st-1-2",
      "question": "Do you validate AI security agent findings for accuracy?",
      "verification": [
        "Review validation process documentation",

      ],
      "evidence": [
        "Validation process documentation",
        "Tracking spreadsheet/database with validation status",
        "Sample of 20 validated vulnerabilities with true/false positive designation",

      ],
      "scoring": {
        "yes_if": "Regular validation process, tracking system exists, analysts confirm",
        "partial_if": "Some validation but not systematic or tracked",
        "no_if": "AI findings accepted without validation"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Success Metrics:**

      "measurement": "(Applications with AI testing / Total high-risk applications) × 100",
      "data_source": "Application inventory + AI testing coverage report",
      "frequency": "Monthly",
      "baseline": "Initial coverage assessment",
      "validation": "Cross-check with manual testing coverage"
    },
    {
      "metric": "Validation Rate",

      "baseline": "0% if no current validation",
      "validation": "Audit validation records for completeness"
    },
    {
      "metric": "Baseline True Positive Rate",
      "target": "Establish baseline (no target yet, just measure)",
      "measurement": "(True positives / Total validated) × 100",
      "data_source": "Validation tracking data",
      "frequency": "Monthly",
      "baseline": "First month establishes baseline",

    },
    {
      "metric": "Known Vulnerability Detection",
      "target": ">60% of known vulnerabilities in test environment detected by AI",

      "frequency": "Quarterly",
      "baseline": "Initial test to establish detection capability",
      "validation": "Test environment independently verified"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Desired Outcomes:**

1. **Basic Trust in AI Findings**
   - Security team knows AI agents find SOME real vulnerabilities
   - Obvious false positives identified and filtered
   - Foundation for improving AI agent accuracy

2. **Visibility into AI Agent Effectiveness**
   - Baseline metrics established (even if not great initially)
   - Can track improvement over time
   - Know which AI agents perform better/worse

3. **Feedback to Vendors**
   - AI agent vendors receive actionable feedback
   - Clear communication about blind spots and false positives
   - Foundation for vendor relationship and improvements

4. **Known Limitations Documented**
   - Team aware of what AI agents CAN'T detect
   - Compensating controls for AI blind spots
   - Realistic expectations (AI is not magic)

**Typical Implementation:**

```json
{
  "time": "1-2 months",
  "effort_hours": "60-100 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "validation_process": "20-30 hours (define process, setup tracking)",
    "baseline_testing": "20-30 hours (test environment, known vuln testing)",
    "metrics_setup": "10-20 hours (dashboard, tracking system)",
    "vendor_engagement": "10-20 hours (feedback sessions, relationship building)"
  },
  "cost_internal": "$12K-$20K (at $200/hr loaded cost)",
  "cost_external": "$20K-$40K (consultant-led process design + tools)",
  "roles_required": [
    "Security testing lead (validation process ownership)",
    "Security analysts (validation execution)",
    "Application security (test environment setup)",
    "Vendor management (vendor feedback coordination)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Validation Bias**
   - Only validating vulnerabilities that look real (selection bias)
   - Not sampling randomly
   - Confirming AI is right without challenging
   - **Solution:** Random sampling, independent validation, document all results

2. **Test Environment Divergence**
   - Test environment doesn't match production
   - Known vulns planted aren't realistic
   - AI agents tuned for test environment (cheating)
   - **Solution:** Production-like test environment, realistic vulnerabilities, blind testing

3. **No Baseline**
   - Starting improvement efforts without knowing current state
   - Can't prove progress without baseline
   - **Solution:** Measure first, improve second

4. **Vendor Blame**
   - Complaining to vendor without specific data
   - Expecting vendor to fix without feedback
   - Not providing examples of false positives/negatives
   - **Solution:** Structured feedback with evidence, collaborate on improvements

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Validation Tracking:**
   - Vulnerability management platforms (Jira, ServiceNow)
   - Custom tracking spreadsheets
   - Security orchestration tools (SOAR)

2. **Test Environments:**
   - OWASP WebGoat, Juice Shop (intentionally vulnerable apps)
   - Cloud sandbox environments
   - Container-based test environments (Docker, K8s)

3. **AI Testing Agents:**
   - SAST: GitHub Advanced Security, Snyk Code
   - DAST: Burp Suite Enterprise, OWASP ZAP
   - Pentesting: Wiz AI, Cobalt AI pentesting

4. **Metrics Dashboards:**
   - Security metrics platforms
   - BI tools (Tableau, Power BI)
   - AI agent vendor dashboards (synthesize)

### ST Level 2: Effective & Resilient AI Security Testing

**Objective:**
Verify AI security agents are effective at finding real vulnerabilities and resilient against adversarial manipulation.

**Activities:**

1. Develop comprehensive test suite for AI agent blind spots
   - Identify vulnerability types AI agents historically miss
   - Create test cases for each blind spot category
   - Run quarterly: Do improvements reduce blind spots?
   - Track coverage across OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25, AI-specific vulns

2. Conduct red team exercises to manipulate AI testing agents
   - Attempt prompt injection attacks on AI agents
   - Try data poisoning (if AI agents use training data)
   - Test evasion techniques (obfuscation, encoding)
   - Document manipulation success rate

3. Establish true positive/false positive targets and tracking
   - Set targets: >75% true positive rate (validated findings are real)
   - Track false positive rate: <25% (noise reduction)
   - Monitor trend: Improving or declining?
   - Tune AI agents based on false positive patterns

4. Implement cross-validation with manual testing
   - Run manual pentests on same applications as AI
   - Compare results: What did AI find vs. manual?
   - Calculate false negative rate: What did AI miss?
   - Use manual testing to continuously validate AI effectiveness

5. Create automated feedback loop for AI agent tuning
   - When false positive found: Feed back to AI agent (reduce noise)
   - When false negative found: Update AI detection rules
   - Track improvement: Is tuning working?
   - Document tuning changes and impact

}
```

**Desired Outcomes:**

1. **High-Confidence AI Findings**
   - Security team can trust 75%+ of AI-reported vulnerabilities without re-validation
   - Reduced wasted effort chasing false positives
   - Faster remediation (don't need to validate everything)

2. **Adversarial Resilience**
   - Attackers cannot easily trick AI security agents
   - AI agents robust against manipulation attempts
   - Known manipulation vectors documented and mitigated

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - AI agents detect wide range of vulnerability types
   - Blind spots identified and compensated (manual testing, additional tools)
   - Confidence that major vulnerability classes won't be missed

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - AI agent effectiveness improving over time (metrics prove it)
   - False positive rate decreasing (less noise)
   - False negative rate decreasing (fewer misses)
   - Data-driven tuning delivers measurable results

**Typical Implementation:**

```json
{
  "time": "2-4 months",
  "effort_hours": "120-200 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "adversarial_testing": "40-60 hours (red team exercises, test case development)",
    "cross_validation": "30-50 hours (manual pentesting for comparison)",
    "metrics_tracking": "20-30 hours (enhanced dashboard, validation workflow)",
    "ai_agent_tuning": "30-60 hours (analysis, configuration changes, testing)"
  },
  "cost_internal": "$24K-$40K (at $200/hr loaded cost)",
  "cost_external": "$50K-$100K (red team services, pentesting, consultant support)",
  "roles_required": [
    "Security testing lead (program management)",
    "Red team (adversarial testing)",
    "Penetration testers (manual validation)",
    "Security analysts (validation, tuning)",
    "AI/ML engineer (AI agent configuration, if applicable)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Adversarial Testing Theater**
   - Red team only tries obvious attacks (not realistic)
   - Tests designed to make AI agents look good
   - No follow-up when manipulation succeeds
   - **Solution:** Independent red team, realistic scenarios, document all findings

2. **False Positive Obsession**
   - Only focus on reducing false positives
   - Ignore false negatives (missed vulnerabilities)
   - Trade-off: Low noise but also low detection
   - **Solution:** Balanced approach, track both FP and FN rates

3. **Tuning Without Validation**
   - Change AI agent settings without measuring impact
   - Can't prove tuning worked
   - Risk making things worse
   - **Solution:** Before/after metrics, A/B testing, controlled experiments

4. **Sample Size Too Small**
   - Claim "75% true positive rate" based on 10 samples
   - Not statistically significant
   - Misleading metrics
   - **Solution:** Require n>100 for percentage claims, document confidence intervals

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Adversarial Testing:**
   - Prompt injection frameworks (for AI agent testing)
   - Evasion toolkits (obfuscation, encoding)
   - Red team playbooks for AI systems

2. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Professional pentesting services
   - Internal red team capabilities
   - Bug bounty programs (crowdsourced validation)

3. **Metrics & Tracking:**
   - Enhanced vulnerability management platforms
   - Statistical analysis tools (for confidence intervals)
   - Trend analysis dashboards

4. **AI Agent Tuning:**
   - Vendor-provided configuration tools
   - Custom rule development (if supported)
   - Training data updates (for ML-based agents)

  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Continuous Testing Overload**
   - Every build triggers hours of testing (slows development)
   - Developers bypass security gates (too slow)
   - False positives block deployments
   - **Solution:** Risk-based testing (full tests for high-risk changes), fast feedback loops, high accuracy

2. **Integration Complexity**
   - Too many tools, poor integration
   - Data silos: Can't correlate findings across tools
   - Alert fatigue: Too many disconnected alerts
   - **Solution:** Unified security platform, API integrations, data normalization

3. **Benchmarking Gamesmanship**
   - Only benchmark on favorable metrics
   - Compare against weak peers
   - Cherry-pick data for external reporting
   - **Solution:** Third-party benchmarking, comprehensive metrics, honest reporting

4. **Innovation Without Validation**
   - Pilot every new AI testing tool (shiny object syndrome)
   - No validation of effectiveness
   - Complexity without value
   - **Solution:** ROI-based pilots, kill unsuccessful pilots, focus on proven tools

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Continuous Testing:**
   - CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
   - Container security (Snyk, Aqua, Prisma Cloud)
   - Runtime application self-protection (RASP)

   - SOAR platforms (Palo Alto XSOAR, Splunk Phantom)
   - GRC platforms (ServiceNow GRC, Archer)

4. **Benchmarking:**
   - HAIAMM community data (when available)
   - Third-party pentesting (NCC Group, Bishop Fox, etc.)
   - Industry surveys and reports

## Practice 3: TA - Threat Assessment (Building)

### Context

**What this practice assesses:**
The organization's ability to identify threats to HAI security programs and assess risks specific to AI agents.

**Why outcomes matter here:**
Generic threat models miss AI-specific risks (prompt injection, model poisoning). Outcome focus ensures threat assessment is RELEVANT to HAI security operations.

**AI-Operated Security Context:**
- AI security agents have unique threat vectors (not in traditional threat models)
- Need to identify: Can attackers manipulate our AI security agents?
- Need to assess: What happens if AI agent fails or is compromised?
- Need to prioritize: Which AI agent threats pose highest business risk?

---

### TA Level 1: Basic AI Security Threat Identification

**Objective:**
Identify basic threats to HAI security operations and establish foundational threat awareness.

**Activities:**

1. Create threat model for AI security agent deployments
   - Identify AI security agents in use (from SM-1 inventory)
   - For each agent: What could go wrong?
   - Basic STRIDE analysis: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
   - Document top 10 threats to HAI security operations

2. Assess threats specific to AI agents (beyond traditional threats)
   - Prompt injection: Can attackers manipulate AI agent inputs?
   - Data poisoning: Can attackers corrupt AI training data?
   - Model extraction: Can attackers steal AI models?
   - Adversarial evasion: Can attackers fool AI agents?
   - Document AI-specific threats identified

3. Prioritize threats by likelihood and business impact
   - For each threat: How likely? (High/Medium/Low)
   - For each threat: What's the business impact if exploited?
   - Risk score: Likelihood × Impact
   - Focus on top 5 highest-risk threats first

4. Establish baseline threat awareness across security team
   - Train security team on AI-specific threats
   - Ensure analysts recognize AI threat patterns
   - Document: Who is responsible for monitoring each threat?
   - Create alert/escalation procedures for AI threats

    }
  ]
}
```

**Desired Outcomes:**

1. **AI Threat Awareness**
   - Security team understands AI agents have unique threat vectors
   - Not treating AI security like traditional security
   - Specific awareness of prompt injection, model poisoning, etc.

2. **Risk-Based Prioritization**
   - Know which AI security threats pose highest business risk
   - Resources focused on biggest threats first
   - Not boiling the ocean (trying to fix everything at once)

3. **Documented Baseline**
   - Threat models exist for reference
   - New team members can learn from documentation
   - Foundation for maturity improvement (Level 2, 3)

4. **Accountability**
   - Clear ownership: Who monitors each AI threat?
   - Alert procedures when AI threats detected
   - Not ad-hoc (systematic approach)

**Typical Implementation:**

```json
{
  "time": "1-2 months",
  "effort_hours": "60-100 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "threat_modeling": "30-50 hours (threat model creation for all AI agents)",
    "ai_threat_research": "15-25 hours (research AI-specific threats, frameworks)",
    "risk_scoring": "10-15 hours (prioritization, risk register)",
    "training": "5-10 hours (security team training delivery)"

    "AI/ML security SME (AI-specific threat identification)",
    "Risk management (risk scoring, prioritization)",
    "Security team (participants in threat modeling)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Generic Threat Models**
   - Using traditional threat model templates
   - Missing AI-specific threats entirely
   - STRIDE analysis without AI context
   - **Solution:** Use MITRE ATLAS, AI security frameworks, AI threat examples

2. **Threat Modeling Theater**
   - Beautiful threat models created but never used
   - No follow-up: Threats identified but not mitigated
   - Annual exercise only (threat landscape evolves)
   - **Solution:** Regular updates, link threats to security controls, action plans

3. **No Prioritization**
   - All threats treated equally (resource dilution)
   - Or only fixing easy threats (ignoring hard, high-risk ones)
   - **Solution:** Risk-based prioritization, force-rank top 10

4. **Awareness Lip Service**
   - "Training" is forwarding an article
   - No validation that team actually learned
   - **Solution:** Interactive training, quizzes, hands-on exercises

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Threat Modeling:**
   - Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool
   - OWASP Threat Dragon
   - IriusRisk (commercial)
   - Threagile (as-code threat modeling)

2. **AI Threat Frameworks:**
   - MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems)
   - NIST AI RMF Playbook
   - OWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide
   - Academic papers on AI security

3. **Training:**
   - AI security training courses (SANS, Offensive Security)
   - Hands-on labs (AI red teaming exercises)
   - Conference talks (DEF CON AI Village, RSA)

4. **Risk Scoring:**
   - FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
   - DREAD framework (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability)
   - Custom risk matrices

### TA Level 2: Comprehensive AI Threat Assessment

**Objective:**
Develop comprehensive threat scenarios for HAI security operations and integrate threat intelligence into AI agent security.

**Activities:**

1. Develop detailed attack scenarios (abuse cases) for AI agents
   - For each high-risk AI security agent: Create 3-5 abuse cases
   - Document: Step-by-step attack scenario, prerequisites, impact
   - Test scenarios: Can our controls actually prevent this?
   - Update based on test results

2. Integrate threat intelligence feeds for AI-specific threats
   - Subscribe to AI security threat intelligence (vendors, open source)
   - Monitor: New AI attack techniques, vulnerabilities in AI tools
   - Alert: When threat intelligence relevant to our AI agents
   - Update threat models based on new intelligence

3. Assess supply chain threats to AI security tools
   - Identify: AI security tool vendors and dependencies
   - Evaluate: Vendor security practices, incident history
   - Document: Supply chain risks (vendor compromise, dependency vulnerabilities)
   - Mitigation: Vendor security requirements, alternative options

4. Prioritize threats by actual exploitability (not just theoretical)
   - For high-risk threats: Conduct PoC exploits
   - Measure: How hard is it to actually exploit? (CVSS exploitability score)
   - Reprioritize: Theoretical high-risk but practically low-exploitable threats downgraded
   - Focus: Practically exploitable threats first

5. Establish threat trend analysis and reporting
   - Track: Are threats increasing/decreasing over time?
   - Analyze: Which new threats emerged this quarter?
   - Report: Quarterly threat briefing to CISO/leadership
   - Adapt: Update security strategy based on threat trends

   - Tested scenarios: Validated that attacks are actually possible
   - Confidence in control effectiveness (or knowledge they're inadequate)

2. **Intelligence-Driven Security**
   - Threat models reflect current threat landscape (not static)
   - Early warning: New AI threats identified before exploitation
   - Proactive updates: AI security adapted to emerging threats

3. **Supply Chain Visibility**
   - Understand dependencies and vendor risks
   - Prepared for supply chain compromise scenarios
   - Mitigation strategies ready if vendor incident occurs

4. **Efficient Resource Allocation**
   - Focus on practically exploitable threats (not theoretical FUD)
   - Resources not wasted on low-exploitability threats
   - Data-driven prioritization (PoC testing proves exploitability)

    "Risk management (threat prioritization)"
  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Abuse Cases Without Testing**
   - Documenting attack scenarios but never testing if they work
   - Assuming controls prevent attacks without validation
   - **Solution:** Mandatory testing for all high-risk abuse cases, red team involvement

2. **Threat Intelligence Overload**
   - Subscribe to 20 feeds, can't process the volume
   - Alert fatigue: Everything flagged as critical
   - **Solution:** Curated feeds, automated filtering, focus on actionable intelligence

3. **Supply Chain Theater**
   - Vendor assessment questionnaires that vendors lie on
   - No validation of vendor responses
   - "We assessed them" but no real risk understanding
   - **Solution:** Technical validation, code review, SBOM analysis, third-party reports

4. **PoC Without Ethics**
   - Testing exploits against production (risky)
   - No approval process for PoC testing
   - Potential legal/ethical violations
   - **Solution:** Ethics review, isolated test environments, legal approval, responsible disclosure

**Tools & Resources:**

1. **Abuse Case Development:**
   - Attack trees (visual attack scenario mapping)
   - MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (for attack technique selection)
   - Abuse case templates and examples

2. **Threat Intelligence:**
   - AI-specific threat feeds (Recorded Future, ThreatConnect)
   - Open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools
   - Vendor-specific threat advisories

3. **Supply Chain Assessment:**
   - SBOM tools (Syft, CycloneDX)
   - Vendor assessment platforms (OneTrust, ProcessUnity)
   - Dependency scanning (Snyk, WhiteSource)

4. **Exploitability Testing:**
   - Proof-of-concept frameworks
   - Isolated testing environments (VMs, containers)
   - Ethical hacking methodologies (OWASP, OSSTMM)

### TA Level 3: Advanced & Predictive AI Threat Assessment

**Objective:**
Proactively predict and prepare for future AI security threats through advanced threat modeling, intelligence analysis, and industry collaboration.

**Activities:**

1. Conduct advanced AI security threat modeling including zero-day scenarios
   - Model sophisticated attack chains (multi-stage AI compromises)
   - Zero-day scenarios: What if unknown AI vulnerability discovered?
   - Cascade analysis: What if one AI agent compromised, impacts on others?
   - Worst-case scenarios: Business impact of complete AI security failure

2. Participate in AI security threat intelligence sharing communities
   - Join industry ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers)
   - Contribute threat intelligence (anonymized) to community
   - Receive early warnings from peers
   - Collaborate on emerging AI threat research

3. Establish predictive threat modeling for emerging AI technologies
   - Monitor: New AI security technologies being developed
   - Assess: Threats these new technologies might introduce
   - Prepare: Threat models for technologies not yet deployed
   - Stay ahead: Proactive rather than reactive threat assessment

4. Integrate threat assessment with business continuity planning
   - Scenario: AI security complete failure - what's the business impact?
   - Plan: How to operate without AI security agents (degraded mode)
   - Test: Tabletop exercises simulating AI security incidents
   - Recover: Procedures to restore HAI security operations after incident

5. Publish anonymized AI threat research to advance industry knowledge
   - Document unique threats discovered
   - Share mitigation strategies (non-proprietary)
   - Present at conferences (RSA, Black Hat, DEF CON)
   - Contribute to open-source AI security tools/frameworks

   - Collective intelligence superior to solo efforts

**Typical Implementation:**

```json
{
  "time": "6-12 months (ongoing)",
  "effort_hours": "300-500 hours",
  "breakdown": {
    "advanced_threat_modeling": "80-120 hours (complex scenarios, modeling)",
    "community_participation": "60-100 hours (meetings, intelligence sharing, research)",
    "predictive_analysis": "80-120 hours (emerging tech monitoring, future threat research)",
    "business_continuity": "40-80 hours (tabletop exercises, plan development)",
    "industry_contribution": "40-80 hours (research, writing, presentations)"
  },
  "cost_internal": "$60K-$100K (at $200/hr loaded cost)",
  "cost_external": "$100K-$200K (consultants, conference sponsorship, research partnerships)",
  "roles_required": [
    "Chief Security Architect (strategic threat vision)",
    "Threat intelligence team (community participation, analysis)",

  ]
}
```

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. **Prediction Speculation**
   - Wild guesses about future threats (not data-driven)
   - Sci-fi scenarios with no grounding
   - **Solution:** Evidence-based prediction, technology trends analysis, expert validation

2. **Intelligence Sharing One-Way**
   - Only taking from community, not contributing
   - "Free rider" problem
   - Community value degradation if everyone only takes
   - **Solution:** Contribution requirements, reciprocity, anonymized sharing

3. **BCP Lip Service**
   - Business continuity plan on paper, never tested
   - Tabletop exercises are checkbox compliance

## Questions for Review

1. **Success Metrics Feasibility:**
   - Are the proposed metrics realistically measurable?
   - Do organizations have data sources to track these metrics?
   - Are targets appropriate (too easy? too hard?)?

2. **Desired Outcomes Relevance:**
   - Do these outcomes match what organizations actually want to achieve?
   - Are they compelling enough to drive adoption?

3. **Implementation Estimates:**
   - Are effort/time/cost estimates realistic for your target market?
   - Should we provide ranges for different organization sizes (startup vs. enterprise)?

4. **Verification Procedures:**
   - Are verification methods practical for assessors?
   - Do they effectively prevent "checkbox compliance"?

5. **Pilot Candidates:**
   - Do you have 1-2 organizations to pilot this with?
   - What feedback mechanisms will we use?
