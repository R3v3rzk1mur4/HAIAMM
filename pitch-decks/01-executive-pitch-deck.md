# HAIAMM - Executive Pitch Deck
## Human Assisted Intelligence Assurance Maturity Model

---

## Slide 1: The Challenge

### AI Implementation Governance is Complex and Uncharted

**The Problem:**
- Organizations deploying AI systems lack comprehensive governance frameworks
- Traditional frameworks (ISO, NIST) don't address AI implementation maturity
- No standardized way to measure organizational maturity in AI governance
- Leadership teams struggle to answer: "How responsibly are we implementing AI?"

**The Gap:**
- 78% of organizations lack formal AI governance assessment processes
- Existing frameworks focus on narrow aspects (risk OR security, not comprehensive maturity)
- No holistic view of AI implementation practices across the organization
- Executive teams lack quantifiable metrics for AI governance maturity

---

## Slide 2: Introducing HAIAMM

### The First Comprehensive AI Implementation Maturity Framework

**What is HAIAMM?**

A desktop application that provides **comprehensive maturity assessment** for organizations implementing Human Assisted Intelligence (AI) systems.

**Built on Proven Foundation:**
- Extends OWASP's OpenSAMM v1.0 (industry-standard maturity framework)
- Specifically designed for AI system governance, building, verification, and operations
- Evidence-based, quantifiable maturity metrics

**Coverage:**
- **6 Implementation Domains** covering the complete AI implementation landscape
- **72 Practice Instances** spanning 24 business functions
- **432 Assessment Criteria** for comprehensive evaluation

---

## Slide 3: Six Comprehensive Implementation Domains

### Complete AI Implementation Coverage

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   SOFTWARE      │      DATA       │ INFRASTRUCTURE  │
│                 │                 │                 │
│ • AI in Apps    │ • Training Data │ • Cloud/On-Prem │
│ • AI-Gen Code   │ • Privacy       │ • Deployment    │
│ • Integration   │ • Quality       │ • Scaling       │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│    VENDORS      │   PROCESSES     │   ENDPOINTS     │
│                 │                 │                 │
│ • Third-Party AI│ • Governance    │ • User Access   │
│ • Supply Chain  │ • Compliance    │ • API Access    │
│ • Risk Mgmt     │ • Workflows     │ • Interfaces    │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Why Six Domains Matter:**
- **Holistic View:** No implementation gap left unassessed
- **Domain Experts:** Each team assesses their area of responsibility
- **Cross-Domain Dependencies:** Understand how AI implementations interact
- **Investment Prioritization:** Focus improvement efforts where they matter most

---

## Slide 6: Competitive Advantage

### Why HAIAMM Stands Out

| Feature | HAIAMM | Traditional Frameworks |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **AI-Specific** | ✓ Designed for AI implementation maturity | General security/risk frameworks |
| **Multi-Domain** | 6 comprehensive domains | Single-dimension or narrow focus |
| **Coverage** | 72 practice instances, 432 criteria | Limited AI implementation practices |
| **Application** | Desktop tool with dashboards | Spreadsheets or manual process |
| **Foundation** | OWASP OpenSAMM v1.0 | Proprietary or no standard |
| **Offline** | Complete offline capability | Cloud-dependent |
| **Open Source** | Based on open standards | Black-box proprietary |

**Unique Value:**
- **First comprehensive** maturity framework for AI implementation across organizations
- **Complete lifecycle coverage** from governance through operations
- **Production-ready** desktop application, not just a framework
- **Extensible architecture** for organization-specific customization
