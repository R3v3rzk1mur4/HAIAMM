# HAIAMM - Quick Overview
## 5-Minute Introduction to Human Assisted Intelligence Maturity

---

## Slide 1: What is HAIAMM?

### Human Assisted Intelligence Assurance Maturity Model

**One-Line Summary:**
A desktop application that helps organizations assess and improve their maturity in deploying Human Assisted Intelligence with appropriate human oversight.

**The Problem:**
Organizations deploying HAI lack structured frameworks to assess governance, human oversight, security, and operational maturity.

**The Solution:**
HAIAMM provides a proven, standardized approach to measuring HAI maturity across 6 critical domains.

**Based On:**
OWASP OpenSAMM v1.0 (industry-standard maturity model) extended specifically for Human Assisted Intelligence.

## Slide 2: How It Works

### Simple 3-Step Process

**Step 1: Choose Your Scope**
- Full assessment (72 practice instances)
- Quick baseline (Level 1 only)
- Custom (select specific domains)

**Step 2: Answer Questions**
- Evidence-based questions on governance, human oversight, and operations
- Auto-save progress
- Collaborative assessment support

**Step 3: Get Results**
- Visual dashboards (radar charts, heatmaps)
- Maturity scores (0-3 scale)
- Actionable improvement roadmap

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours for full assessment

## Slide 3: Six HAI Domains

### Complete Human Assisted Intelligence Coverage

| Domain | What It Covers |
|--------|----------------|
| **Software** | HAI in applications, AI-assisted development, human-AI collaboration in code |
| **Infrastructure** | HAI deployment environments, scaling with human oversight |
| **Endpoints** | User interfaces where humans interact with AI, APIs, access controls |
| **Data** | Data governance for HAI, privacy, quality, human-AI data interactions |
| **Processes** | Business processes with HAI, compliance, human oversight workflows |
| **Vendors** | Third-party HAI services, vendor management, supply chain |

**Why Six Domains?**
Traditional frameworks don't address human-AI collaboration. HAI requires comprehensive coverage across the entire deployment lifecycle.

### What You'll See

**Multi-Domain Radar Chart:**
```
          Software (2.1)
                │
    Vendors ────┼──── Infrastructure
      (1.8)     │        (2.5)
                │
  Processes ────┼──── Endpoints
    (2.3)       │        (1.9)
                │
              Data
             (2.7)
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Strengths:** Data security (2.7), Infrastructure (2.5)
- **Gaps:** Vendors (1.8), Endpoints (1.9)
- **Priority:** Focus security investments on vendor risk and API security

**Maturity Levels:**
